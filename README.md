# Buck_Converter
For the Simulation of a Buck Converter with LC filter on R Load. A MATLAB Simulink model created with a 200V , 0.2 Ohm Internal Resistance connected to a thyristor, whose gate port is connected to a seperate pulse generator with the details defined in the simulink model. The output from the thyristor is connected to a R load filtered with a Capacitor and Reactor. The output DC values are calculated and Efficiency of the output is displayed for the Performance of the Converter.
